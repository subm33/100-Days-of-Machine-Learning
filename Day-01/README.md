# Day 01 – Introduction to Machine Learning

## What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning allows computers to learn from data and make predictions
without being explicitly programmed.

## Types of Machine Learning
- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning

## ML Workflow
Data → Model → Train → Predict
